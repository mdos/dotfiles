# Install notes

# Installing *most* things

Use brew
Run brew doctor every so often to make sure your env isn't tainted. Strange
stuff can happen in /usr/local/

# Installing node / yarn

Install nvm. Use that to install specific node version. 
nvm install 8
Install yarn via brew, not npm

# Install history
brew install nvm
nvm install 8
brew install yarn
brew install git
